### Maintainer Review

This section defines the review process for contributions.

- Immediate acceptance: This is the case when a contribution is
  determined to advance the project. With this outcome, implementation
  of the contribution becomes an open task immediately.
- Conditional acceptance: When a contribution is determined to advance
  the project, but requiring only trivial improvements to be accepted.
- Challenge accepted: When a contribution would advance the project,
  provided that a significant and non-trivial problem is solved.
- Honorably archived: When a contribution would not advance the project
  without solving significant and non-trivial problems that are left
  unsolved by the contribution, but where the contribution reflects an
  honest effort towards advancing the project. Persons submitting any
  contribution received this outcome grants the person submitting
  status as contributor.
- Rejected: When a contribution is determined to not advance the
  project and where the contribution in the opinion of maintainers does
  not reflect an honest effort towards advancing the project.

### Maintainer Responsibilities
