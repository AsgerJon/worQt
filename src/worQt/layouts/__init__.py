'worQt' library. These widgets provide the layouts functionalities such as
printing text, displaying images, reacting to user inputs and layout
management. Single function button widgets are also provided here, but
more complicated widgets such as sliders and widgets containing multiple
child widgets are provided in the 'worQt.widgets' module. """
