"""Timing core and table renderer for the benchmarks.

Methodology, so the numbers survive a hostile reading:

- Each operation is timed with 'timeit.Timer' using a string 'stmt',
  so the work runs inside timeit's own loop with no per-iteration
  Python function-call wrapper to distort cheap operations.
- 'Timer.autorange' picks an iteration count large enough that the
  total run dominates clock granularity.
- The reported time is the MINIMUM across repeats. For a micro-
  benchmark noise is one-sided (scheduling, GC, cache), so the min is
  the cleanest estimate of the true cost, not the mean.
- Results are reported as a ratio against a chosen baseline, because
  absolute nanoseconds are machine-specific but the ratio is the part
  that actually transfers between machines.
