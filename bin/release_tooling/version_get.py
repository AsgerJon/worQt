"""
This script returns the upcoming version number. It requires one argument
specifying the workflow, one of either:
- 'dev'
- 'rc'
- 'lts'
- 'minor'
- 'major'
The version numbering returned is the next version number for the
specified workflow. If it returns '1.2.3' for 'lts', it means that the
next LTS release should be version '1.2.3'. The dev version has the same
version as the next lts release, but with a '-dev' suffix. For example,
if the next LTS release is '1.2.3', the dev version is '1.2.3-dev0' for
the first dev version. Release candidates follow the same scheme, but with
the '-rc' suffix. For example, if the next LTS release is '1.2.3',
the first release candidate is '1.2.3-rc0'.

  resolved version is exported under that name through 'GITHUB_ENV' (the
  channel used by GitHub Actions to pass a value to later steps); when
  omitted, the version is printed to stdout so a local caller can read it
  directly. It returns 0 on success, and a non-zero integer on failure.

  Parameters
  ----------
  *args : str
    The command-line arguments passed to the script, excluding the script
    name. The first selects the workflow:
    - 'dev': The development workflow, with version strings in the format
      'X.Y.Z-devN', where X, Y, Z and N are integers. The X.Y.Z part is
      the same as the next LTS version number, and the N part is the next
      dev version number, starting from 0.
    - 'rc': The release candidate workflow, with version strings in the
      format 'X.Y.Z-rcN', where X, Y, Z and N are integers. The X.Y.Z part
      is the same as the next LTS version number, and the N part is the
      next release candidate version number, starting from 0.
    - 'lts': The long-term support workflow, with version strings in the
      format 'X.Y.Z', where X, Y and Z are integers. The X part is the
      next major
      version number, the Y part is the next minor version number, and the
      Z part is the next micro version number.
    - 'minor': The minor version update incrementing the minor version
    number, zeroing the micro number.
    - 'major': The major version update incrementing the major version
    number, zeroing the minor and micro numbers.

    An optional second argument names an environment variable. When it is
    present, the resolved version is exported under that name through
    'GITHUB_ENV'; when it is absent, the version is printed to stdout.

  Returns
  -------
  int
    0 on success, and a non-zero integer on failure. Possible failure codes:
    - 1: No arguments provided.
    - 2: More than two arguments provided.
    - 3: Unrecognized workflow argument.
    - 4: Exception raised while exporting the version string.
